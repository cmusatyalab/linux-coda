Coda Filesystem: kernel module
==============================

To build a coda.o / coda.ko module for your Linux kernel:
---------------------------------------------------------

For 4.x kernels:
- sudo dkms add linux4.x
- sudo dkms build coda/6.7

For 3.x kernels:
    won't work until the necessary compatibility glue is added to kver_compat.h.

For 2.4/2.6 kernels:
- make
- sudo make install

For 2.0/2.2 kernels:
- These haven't been updated for 128-bit file identifiers and other API
  changes (and aren't actively being maintained). They are probably hard
  to build and even when they do they won't work with any current Coda
  client releases.

---------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1: This code should always be newer than or equal to what is in the
	latest official Linux kernel release.

NOTE 2: You only need a kernel module for a Coda client.
